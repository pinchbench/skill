Write a python script that will take each of the tasks in tasks/ and load them into memory so that we can then create benchmarks against one or all of them by creating openclaw agents.

For now don't worry about the actual benchmarking, just the loading of the tasks and scallfold the creation of the agents. We'll do the actual creation later but I want it to have nice python logging in place, etc.

Also be sure to use uv so that we can just run it without worrying too much about virtual environments, etc.
